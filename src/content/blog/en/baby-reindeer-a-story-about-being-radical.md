## My Thoughts

Baby Reindeer works because a rude story but it is the story of the all the people of world. It is about of finding a place in this world, it is about of finding the place in this world with someone else gives us his attentions.

It's about being courageous.

The most arresting scene of the series is the climax when Dunn falls and tells his rude and critical story from the stage.

The stage. The place where catharsis comes out like the course of a stream.

To escape from his story, Dunn cannot radically live his passion, he cannot take the position of telling himself that if he wants to be a comedian he cannot do anything else. If he wants Tari he will have to face his fears, he will have to take a specific position.

Martha is the representation of these problems.

She wants him. Just one thing and stop.
She gives her life for this.

Simple, direct, uncompromising and doesn't care what others think of her.

She is brave, she is violent if she needs to.

Ultimately, Dunn continues to listen to Martha's recorded messages. Martha's recorded messages are her medicine for the illness that has been his life.

I left this comment to this review, it is Italian.

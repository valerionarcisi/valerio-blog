I'm happy to share that Caramella has been officially selected at the Bracciano International Film Exhibition, where it will be screened on June 14, 2025.
It's the first step in the festival journey of this short film, and I couldn't ask for a better start.


The project was born from a creative exercise at the Officine Mattòli filmmaking school, during a conversation between me and Veronica Ferretti — who not only inspired the story but also brought it to life on screen as the lead character.
Caramella is a story about self-determination, defeat, and lightness.


A small journey inside a shoe factory, outside of oneself, and then back in again. A film that started with a box of candies being passed around the factory floor, and with all those who — like Ilenia — try every day not to give up on who they are.

I'm deeply grateful to everyone who walked with me on this path and who — in one way or another — “ate candies” to help make this film happen.
A special thanks to _Malloni for hosting us during production, and to Giulio Malloni, who even made a brief on screen.

See you in Bracciano 🍬

I finished shooting *Non fa ridere*.

Four days of filming at Ristorante L'Oasi del Gusto in Piane di Falerone, with a crew and cast who gave everything they had. Time was short, there was so much to do, and it wasn't always easy.

On the third day I woke up with a fever. The very day we had a full house: sixty people between crew, cast, and extras. It wasn't the best time to be sick, but I had no choice. We pushed forward.

It was my first time working with professional actors, and their proactivity was a lifesaver. When insecurity knocked at the door — and it always does, ready to tear down every ambition — knowing that you have people next to you who know exactly what to do made all the difference.

Having a crew of amazing, always available young people, and the closeness of **Stefano Teodori** and **Diego Capomagi** on cinematography, is what kept the ship afloat. **Martina Iacopini** as assistant director, **Daniele Viozzi** as assistant, **Andrea Gobbi** on sound, **Francesca Zu** on set design, **Elena Martusciello** on costumes, **Angelica De Santis** on makeup, **Jacopo Fermani** on DIT and video backstage, **Roberta Malizia** on backstage photography — each one of them made possible something I could never have done alone.

A special thanks to **Fabbrika Kreativa** for their support, materials, and moral encouragement.

But what touched me most was going back to that restaurant. I used to go there all the time as a teenager. Returning as a director, with a crew and actors, was something deeply moving. One of those things you can't quite put into words.

Now the editing begins. *Non fa ridere* still has a long way to go. But the hardest part — and the most beautiful — is done.

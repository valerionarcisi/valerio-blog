On February 22 we stepped on stage at the Teatro Beato Pellegrino in Falerone for *Come nasce un corto?* (How is a short film born?), an evening dedicated to telling the story of the creative process behind our short films.

We screened *Arturo* and *Caramella*, and right after we sat down to talk about them with the audience. On stage with me were **Stefano Teodori**, co-author and director of photography, **Giacomo Bottoni**, actor, and **Daniele Viozzi**, assistant director of *Caramella* and production and directing assistant of *Non fa ridere*. The evening was moderated by **Eleonora Concetti**, city councilor for culture.

The audience was very engaged. One man kept pushing on the technical side, convinced that I delegate editing to Stefano. That's not how it works. Stefano and I share every phase, from artistic choices to technical ones. We split the organizational and production side on one hand and the more technical side on the other, but every decision is made together. It has always been that way.

Then came the moment for *Arturo*. A short film that is over ten years old, featuring people of a certain age. Some of them are no longer with us. Remembering them on stage, in front of those images, was both inevitable and necessary.

*Caramella*, on the other hand, was moving as always. Watching it again never gets old. The ending remains a well-placed punch.

But the hardest part was coming back home. It had been so many years since I last returned to Falerone, and coming back like this — with a full house, me on stage and my family sitting there watching me — was something beyond words.

The people who came to say hello and thank me afterwards. Former neighbors. My childhood best friend's mom. It was deeply moving.

Sometimes you just need to go back where you started to realize how far you've come.

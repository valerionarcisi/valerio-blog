Saturday, October 26, 2025, something extraordinary happened, **the unthinkable**: **Caramella** won the award for **best Marchigiano auteur film** at the 37th edition of the **Fano International Film Festival**.

When I got the news, I couldn't believe it. This recognition comes at a very significant moment for the short film, which had already won the **GASP prize** at the Mostra del Cinema di Bracciano back in June. But winning in your own region, in the Marche, has an even more special flavor.

## In the company of giants

But what makes this award even more surreal is the context in which it came. **Caramella** was competing alongside extraordinary films like **Playing God** -- the Italian stop-motion that made it onto the shortlist for the **2026 Oscars** as Best Animated Short Film -- and **The Boy with White Skin** by Simon Panay, a powerful Franco-Senegalese short that toured international festivals around the world. At the same festival, a film starring **Vincent Cassel** was also awarded.

It was absurd seeing Caramella alongside these works. A short film born as a **diploma project for Officine Mattoli**, now sharing the same stage with Oscar-nominated films and big names in international cinema.

*In fact, it went pretty much like this! :)*

## The journey of Caramella

Caramella is not just a film project, it's a piece of heart that has traveled through festivals and screenings, gathering praise and touching audiences. After the success in Bracciano, this new recognition at the Fano International Film Festival confirms that the story we wanted to tell has found its way.

The Fano International Film Festival is an event of national and international prestige, dedicated to promoting independent auteur cinema and the innovative linguistic explorations of young directors. Being part of this selection and winning in the Marchigiano category means a lot to me, originally from Falerone and living in Porto Sant'Elpidio.

## Dedication and thanks

I want to dedicate this award to **Veronica Ferretti**, the extraordinary lead actress of Caramella, who poured her heart and soul into this project. Special thanks also go to my family, who have always supported me on this artistic path, believing in me even in the hardest moments.

## Next steps

Caramella continues its journey, but we're already working on the next chapter. The new project is called **"Non fa ridere"**, a **dramedy** that explores themes of **freedom and privilege** in a way where nothing is taken for granted. It's a project very close to my heart, and I hope it can carry forward the conversation started with Caramella.

This recognition at the Fano Film Festival gives me even more motivation to keep telling stories that can move people, make them think, and above all, that aren't afraid to question certainties.

If you want to follow Caramella's journey and find out about upcoming screenings and projects, stay tuned. There are still many stops to share together.

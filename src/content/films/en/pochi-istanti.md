Pochi Istanti is a short film directed by [Jacopo Fermani](https://www.instagram.com/phjacopofermani/), with a screenplay by Fermani, myself and [Martina Iacoponi](https://www.instagram.com/iacoponimartina/).

The drone's journey takes it through a quaint village, where it captures snippets of a radio broadcast discussing the global environmental crisis and the need for sustainable development. As the drone continues its flight, the lines between reality and illusion blur, leading to a disorienting and thought-provoking conclusion. The film reflects on the intersection of technology, nature, and human perception.

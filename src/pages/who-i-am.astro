					Greetings! I am Valerio, a seasoned professional with a diverse
					background spanning web development and filmmaking, currently based
					Le Marche, Italy.
				  </p>

				  <h2>Web Development Expertise:</h2>
				  <p>
					In my current role as a Fullstack Developer at <a
					  href="https://www.cleafy.com/">Cleafy</a
					>, I focus on refactoring large PHP apps into modern Javascript.
					Prior to this, I held a Senior Frontend Developer position at <a
					  href="https://www.teamsystem.com/">Teamsystem</a
					> where i utilized technologies such as Angular, Typescript and Ngrx.
				  </p>
				  <p>
					During this experience, I had the opportunity to serve as an
					internal speaker at a conference focused on Flux Architecture,
					employing Redux Toolkit and Ngrx.
				  </p>
				  <p>
					I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at <a
					  href="http://fieldtronics.it/">Fieldtronics Srl</a
					>. Here, I utilized technologies such as Node.js, React, Docker, and
					Serverless to drive innovation in agricultural solutions.
				  </p>
				  <p>
					My journey in web development began at <a
					  href="https://www.new-system.it/">New System Srl</a
					>, where I cultivated my skills as a PHP and WordPress developer.

				  <h2>Filmmaking Journey:</h2>
				  <p>
					Alongside my passion for web development, I have a deep-rooted interest in storytelling through film. With a degree from <a href="https://www.officinemattoli.it/">Officine Mattoli</a>, I have written and directed several short films, and I possess a strong understanding of screenwriting and production organization. As an Assistant Director, I excel in managing on-set logistics, ensuring smooth communication, and maintaining a focused, efficient environment, which allows the creative team to work seamlessly toward the final vision.
